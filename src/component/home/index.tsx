  // fetch data.
  //
  // Props you can pass into PlasmicHome are:
  // 1. Variants you want to activate,
  // 2. Contents for slots you want to fill,
  // 3. Overrides for any named node in the component to attach behavior and data,
  // 4. Props to set on the root node.

  // By default, we are just piping all HomeProps here, but feel free
  // to do whatever works for you.
